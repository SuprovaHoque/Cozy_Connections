# Cozy_Connections
This was the project our team completed for our very first hackathon, Hack the Change 2023! Our task was to devise a tech-driven solution to work towards and promote sustainable living. Inspired by the excessive clothing waste produced by fast fashion, our team worked to create Cozy Connections: a web platform that connects individuals looking to donate old clothes to families in need of clothing.
